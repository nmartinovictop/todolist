Odin project todolist

- [x] Clear the modal when a user hits submit
This was tough and will need to be refactored if I have a chance
- [x] Add projects as a header
Ok. I have built in some functionality so that whenever a user creates a new project, it will show up as a header.  Also, if a user creates a task and a header has not been created, then it will create a new project and show it.
- [x] Have all tasks appear under the all project.
Tasks are now being added correctly
- [x] add checkbox to task to mark if something is complete or not
- [x] make the checkbox adjust whether something isCompleted or not
- [x] working on adding local storage
- [x] Clicking on all should show all tasks
- [x] figure out how I want tasks displayed
- [x] add tasks with all fields correctly
- [ ] display tasks correctly so that they are not all askew
