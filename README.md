# todolist
Odin project todolist

- [x] Clear the modal when a user hits submit
This was tough and will need to be refactored if I have a chance
- [x] Add projects as a header
Ok. I have built in some functionality so that whenever a user creates a new project, it will show up as a header.  Also, if a user creates a task and a header has not been created, then it will create a new project and show it.
- [ ] Have all tasks appear under the all project.
Q: what should tasks look like?
